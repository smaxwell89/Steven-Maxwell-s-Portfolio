## Project 1: Glass Identification

> Using a data set with the refractive indices and weight percent of eight oxides of 214 glass shards, this study sought to find out which oxides were more prevalent between different categories of glass as well as whether the chemical composition and refractive index determined the different types of glass. A MANOVA found that some oxides were good indicators for some glass types but not for others. Additionally, MANOVA contrast tests found a significant difference between the groups of: windows vs non-window glass, building vs vehicle glass, and float vs non-float glass. Discriminant analysis found that the success rates for classifying windows vs non-windows, as well as for classifying building vs vehicle glass, were higher than the success rate for classifying float vs non-float glass. 


## Project 2: Finding Full Moon Effects on Mental Health Admissions

> Using data from a study that sought to find whether there were full moon effects on the admission numbers of the emergency room in a mental health hospital, this study sought to determine specifically what the effects were. Two-Way ANOVA tests found an effect for season but not for full moon, F(3, 30) = 5.25, p-value = 0.0049.
