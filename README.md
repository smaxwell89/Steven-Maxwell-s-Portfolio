## Glass Identification

> Using a data set with the refractive indices and weight percent of eight oxides of 214 glass shards, this study sought to find out which oxides were more prevalent between different categories of glass as well as whether the chemical composition and refractive index determined the different types of glass. A MANOVA found that some oxides were good indicators for some glass types but not for others. Additionally, MANOVA contrast tests found a significant difference between the groups of: windows vs non-window glass, building vs vehicle glass, and float vs non-float glass. Discriminant analysis found that the success rates for classifying windows vs non-windows, as well as for classifying building vs vehicle glass, were higher than the success rate for classifying float vs non-float glass. 


## [Finding Full Moon Effects on Mental Health Admissions](https://github.com/smaxwell89/Full-Moon)

> Using data from a study that sought to find whether there were full moon effects on the admission numbers of the emergency room in a mental health hospital, this study sought to determine specifically what the effects were. Two-Way ANOVA tests found an effect for season but not for full moon, F(3, 30) = 5.25, p-value = 0.0049.

## Sunspots: A Time Series Analysis

> We investigated the monthly sunspot data set that can be found at the Machine Learning Mastery website (https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-datasets-for-machine-learning/). This data set contains 2,820 observations of sunspots that were taken over the course of 230 years, from 1749 to 1983. The total number of sunspots fluctuates from year to year with an average cycle of 11 years. We were interested in predicting the number of sunspots in the next 11 year cycle. Using time series analysis techniques, we fit a SARIMA model to the data and produced forecasts of the next 11-year cycle for the data up to 1993.

## Analysis of Maryland Resident’s Income

> Using data from the American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, an analysis of Maryland residents’ income was conducted to identify variables which significantly impact an individual’s yearly earnings. This analysis seeks to answer the following two questions: 1.) In Maryland in 2019, what was the effect of being employed in a given sector or industry of the economy on the wages earned over the last year? 2.) Of the people in Maryland who made more than $10,000 USD in the last 12 months, what is the effect their industry has on their income? Additionally, this analysis seeks to create a model to predict the income of a person in Maryland based on their educational attainment and age.


## Kaggle’s Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction Challenge

> Using the data provided by Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance company Port Seguro, we used bagging and boosting methods to create models to predict the probability of a driver initiating an automotive insurance claim within the next year. Keeping the cost of insurance affordable relies on the accuracy of these predictions and over the past 20 years, Porto Seguro has relied on various machine learning techniques but are seeking more accurate models to ensure the affordability of their insurance.
